Facilate commands and patterns of commands I find myself needing.

You can either execute the command files, i.e. `./s3cat.sh <bucket> <object/path> or alias the commands in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file.

## s3cat.sh

cat out an ojbect from an s3 bucket.

```bash
s3cat <bucket> <object/path>
```
